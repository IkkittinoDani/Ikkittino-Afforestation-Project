## 🔍 Problem Statement

High rates of deforestation and overgrazing are threatening the delicate ecosystem of the Kafa Biosphere, resulting in habitat loss, reduced biodiversity, and negative socio-economic impacts on local communities.

---

## 🌱 Our Solution

We tackle these challenges through:
1. **Community Awareness Programs**: Educating locals on the importance of preserving the environment.
2. **Sustainable Livelihood Initiatives**: Introducing beekeeping and coffee agroforestry as alternative income sources.
3. **Afforestation and Reforestation**: Planting native tree species and restoring degraded land areas.
4. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Partnering with local government, NGOs, and community groups to support long-term conservation efforts.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Reforest 50 hectares of degraded land in the Kafa Biosphere.
- Plant and nurture 50,000 native tree seedlings over the next 12 months.
- Train 100+ local farmers in sustainable agricultural practices and beekeeping.
